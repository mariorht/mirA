## **mirA: A Lightweight Tiling Window Manager for Mir**

mirA is a lightweight **tiling window manager** built on top of **Mir**. It provides efficient window management with **workspaces, keyboard-driven controls, and auto-tiling**. The goal of mirA is to offer a structured and intuitive window management experience while keeping the implementation simple.

### **Design Decisions**

#### **1. Grid-Based Tiling Layout**
mirA organizes windows in a **grid pattern** rather than dynamic stacking or floating layouts. This choice ensures that all open windows are neatly arranged without overlapping.

#### **2. Workspace Support**
mirA implements **workspaces**, allowing users to group applications into separate virtual desktops.
- Users can **switch between workspaces** using keyboard shortcuts.
- Windows can be **moved across workspaces**, allowing dynamic organization based on user needs.

#### **3. Fullscreen Support**
MirA includes **fullscreen mode**. When a window is set to fullscreen:
- All other windows are hidden.
- The active window occupies the entire screen.
- Exiting fullscreen restores the previous tiling layout.

#### **4. Minimalist Approach to System UI**
To simplify configuration and avoid complexity, mirA includes two **special-purpose applications**:
- **A panel application:** Acts as a lightweight system bar for essential functions.
- **A wallpaper application:** Manages the desktop background without interfering with tiling behavior.

#### **5. No Drag & Drop or Window Resizing**
mirA **does not support** manual dragging or resizing of windows. Instead:
- Windows are arranged according to the **grid layout**.
- Users can move windows between workspaces, but manual adjustments to size and position are not required.

## **Future Improvements**
- [ ] **Better layout management**  
  _Improve how windows are tiled dynamically based on available space._
- [ ] **Floating window support**  
  _Allow certain windows to be free-floating outside the tiling layout._
- [ ] **Stack view support**  
  _Enable a mode where windows stack within a container._
- [ ] **Reorder windows**  
  _Allow moving windows within the same workspace without resizing._
